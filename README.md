# CVR-Custom-Locomotion
My personal Custom Locomotion Layer for CVR! (Includes a small tutorial on how to add it to your avatar!)

In the current State, it IS useable, but is NOT fully thought out yet! I have MANY plans for this Locomotion package.

Please use CCK v3.10 or above.


My UnityPackages uploaded here, require one or more of the following credits, or scripts...
